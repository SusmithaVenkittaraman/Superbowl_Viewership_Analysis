# Superbowl_Viewership_Analysis

Superbowl data has been analyzed using python to uncover insights on the game outcomes, TV viewership, advertisement costs, and halftime performances.
There are three data sets.
One is the Superbowl data, which has columns like winning team, combined points, and point differences. The second data frame has columns related to show ratings, the average number of viewers, advertisement costs. The third data frame has the details about the musicians and the number of songs they performed.

# Getting started

1.The script for the analysis is written in python using Jupyter Notebook. The file has to be opened in Jupyter Notebooks.
2.All the three datasets are in the datasets folder in the repository.

# Results and findings

1. A histogram has been plot to understand the spread of combined points, and the games with maximum and minimum combined points are uncovered. SuperBowl 29 held in Florida had the highest combined points of 75. Superbowl 7 had the lowest combined points of 21.
2. When the point difference is more, then there are chances that people will tend to change the channel. To prove the above insights, the scatter plot with a linear regression model is fit, and it is true that when the difference is high, the viewership goes down.
3. The ratings and the average number of viewers increased simultaneously, whereas the networks fall behind in increasing the advertisement cost.
4. The halftime performance data has been analyzed. The most repeatedly performed bands were identified. On average, the performers performed for 1 to 3 songs, and the maximum was 11 songs performed by Justin Timberlake in Superbowl 52.

# Limitations
1. The dataset is smaller for further analysis. The number of games held so far is less, and hence it is the limitation of the examination.
